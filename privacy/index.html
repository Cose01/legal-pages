  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Milao (“we”, “us”, “our”) processes personal data when you use the Milao mobile application.
    Milao is currently available on iOS via the Apple App Store and can be downloaded worldwide unless local laws restrict availability.
    We process personal data in accordance with the EU/EEA General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@milaoapp.com">support@milaoapp.com</a> for any privacy questions.
  </p>

  <h2>What data we collect.</h2>
  <p>
    When you create and use your Milao account, we process account information such as your username, user ID, and email address.
    As you study, you can create and store AI generated content and other text on flashcards. We also provide learning statistics
    (e.g. the number of cards studied per day and your card ratings) so you can track your progress. We also use this data to
    opitmize the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    We receive data directly from you when you register, create content and study. For purchases and subscriptions, certain data
    come from the Apple App Store and its associated services.
  </p>

  <h2>Purposes and legal bases.</h2>
  <p>
    We process your data to provide Milao’s core functionality, including account creation, synchronization, saving of decks and cards,
    and displaying your learning statistics. The legal basis is contract performance under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. We also process data
    to maintain, secure, improve the service, and the prevention of misuse; this relies on our legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f)
    GDPR in ensuring a stable, secure, and efficient service. We handle customer support and service communications to respond to your
    inquiries and keep you informed about important changes; the legal basis is contract performance and/or legitimate interests. From
    time to time, we may contact you by email with tips, product updates, or offers. Where required, we rely on your consent under
    Article 6(1)(a) GDPR; otherwise, where permitted, we rely on legitimate interests in direct marketing. You can opt out at any time
    as described below. We process purchase and subscription data to verify transactions, manage access entitlements, handle renewals
    and refunds, and meet tax and accounting obligations; the legal bases are contract performance and legal obligation under
    Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. Where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time with effect for the future. Where we rely on
    legitimate interests, you may object to the processing.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-party services (processors).</h2>
  <p>
    We use service providers who process data on our behalf. Our main processors include: Supabase for backend database, authentication,
    storage, and related logs; and RevenueCat for subscription and receipt management.
  </p>

  <h2>Payments and subscriptions (Apple).</h2>
  <p>
    All subscriptions are processed by Apple. We receive purchase receipts and subscription status (weekly, monthly, or yearly) but not
    your payment details. Apple may act as an independent controller for its own processing. Please also review Apple’s privacy
    information.
  </p>

  <h2>Retention.</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your account data and learning content for the life of your account. When you delete your account or request deletion,
    we delete or anonymize associated personal data within 90 days unless we must retain certain records longer to comply with legal
    obligations or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. Support emails are retained for 24 months to help resolve issues and
    maintain service history.
  </p>
  <p>
    Milao is not intended for children under 17. We do not knowingly collect data from children below the applicable age.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy.</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will publish the updated version in the app and change the “Last updated”
    date above.
  </p>
