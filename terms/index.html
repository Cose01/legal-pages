  </header>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a binding agreement between you and Milao (“Milao,” “we,” “us,” “our”). By accessing or using the Milao iOS app (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope &amp; Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms govern your use of the Milao iOS application and any related features. You must be 18 years or older and comply with all applicable laws. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Account</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for your account and any activity under it. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, our policies, or the law, or that pose security or fraud risks.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Service</h2>
  <p>
    Milao provides an AI-based language-learning tool including decks, flashcards, and learning statistics. We do not provide certifications and do not guarantee learning outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI can make mistakes. Translations and outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate in certain contexts. Use your own judgment and verify important results, especially for professional or sensitive use cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parts of the Service are powered by OpenAI’s large language models and other third-party technologies. Dates and times shown or used in the Service are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which may differ from your local time zone.
  </p>

  <h2>4. License</h2>
  <p>
    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the app for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse-engineer, or resell the Service or any part of it, except as allowed by mandatory law.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Content</h2>
  <p>
    You may submit or create content (e.g., flashcards, decks, text) (“User Content”). You are solely responsible for your User Content. Do not upload anything illegal, infringing, harmful, or deceptive.
  </p>
  <p>
    You grant Milao a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, display, and process your User Content only as needed to provide and improve the Service (e.g., syncing, backups, moderation, analytics). This license ends when your content is deleted from our systems, subject to reasonable backup and archival periods.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Subscriptions (Apple)</h2>
  <p>
    We offer weekly, monthly, and yearly subscription plans via Apple In-App Purchase. Subscriptions auto-renew until you cancel in your Apple ID settings or in the App.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Billing &amp; Taxes: Apple handles billing and may include applicable taxes as required by law.</li>
    <li>Refunds: Refunds (if any) are governed by Apple’s policies.</li>
    <li>Price Changes: We may change prices with prior notice where required. If you do not agree, cancel before the next billing period.</li>
    <li>Manage: View, change, or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to the Service</h2>
  <p>
    We may add, change, or remove features at any time. We will provide notice of material changes where required. We are not obligated to maintain any particular feature.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Availability &amp; Support</h2>
  <p>
    The Service may be unavailable from time to time for maintenance, updates, failures, or events beyond our control. We provide basic support via <a href="mailto:support@milaoapp.com">support@milaoapp.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or accurate (including AI outputs and translations).
  </p>

  <h2>10. Liability</h2>
  <p>
    Subject to the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by law, Milao’s liability is limited to typical, foreseeable damages and, where lawful, capped at the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim. Statutory consumer rights remain unaffected.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Indemnity</h2>
  <p>
    Where permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Milao from claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your unlawful use of the Service or your User Content that violates these Terms or third-party rights.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You may stop using the Service, terminate your subscription and delete your account at any time. Data handling and retention are governed by our Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Payments and subscriptions are processed by Apple and are subject to Apple’s terms and policies. The Service may contain links to external sites; we are not responsible for third-party content or practices.
